This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6 where a catch-all route (`/*`) placed before other routes causes conflicts.  The `App.js` file contains the buggy code, showing the incorrect route order. The `AppSolution.js` file provides the corrected code with the catch-all route placed last to resolve the issue.  This ensures that more specific routes are matched before the catch-all route is used.
